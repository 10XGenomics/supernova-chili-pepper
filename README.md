This is an unsupported branch of the Supernova repository. This branch was used to assemble the chili pepper assembly as described in [Hulse-Kemp et al, 2017][1]. The assembly was generated during Supernova development with an experimental option called 'ULTRA'. The ULTRA option causes scaffolds that are connected in the assembly graph to be disconnected from each other prior to another round of scaffolding.  This increases scaffold length, although the general effects on scaffold accuracy have not been fully tested. This option has been removed from Supernova and is not available in the current version of Supernova.

This repo is being released to support the publication of the chili pepper genome paper. No further development on this branch is planned, and this is not supported by 10x Genomics.
